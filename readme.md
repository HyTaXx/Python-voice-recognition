# Speech recognition calculator

This project will help you with your maths. Tell your computor any operation and it will quickly give you the results.

## How is this working ?

We used NumPy and Google-Speech-recognition to give you the results (*in french*) . Next to that, we made sure that the microphone gets  **precise** data to ensure the quality of the response.
